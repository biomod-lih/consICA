Description: consICA implements a data-driven deconvolution method – consensus 
  independent component analysis (ICA) to decompose heterogeneous omics data and 
  extract features suitable for patient diagnostics and prognostics. 
  The method separates biologically relevant transcriptional signals from 
  technical effects and provides information about the cellular composition and biological processes.
  The implementation of parallel computing in the package ensures efficient 
  analysis of modern multicore systems.
